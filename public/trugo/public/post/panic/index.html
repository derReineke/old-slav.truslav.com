		<p><strong>FRIDAY</strong> – In what many would call the “darkest days since root vegetable famine,” the country is tested as the wireless network fails across all of Truslavistan, crippling the new economy set-up by Petrov Manishlakov last week,</p>

<p>from his house. The general unease of the nation can be felt for kilometers, with some destabilizing underneath the pressure.</p>

<p>Ljudevit Snizdivzic, age 49, was seen two days ago running naked, covered in mud, through the back village streets shouting nonsense and making bizarre animal noises all throughout the night like he does every Wednesday, showing that mental strength still prevails among the public in these dire times.</p>

<p>However, with Father Nikolai attending 0800 liturgy instead of being passed out at the bar, some fear that an impassable shadow has overtaken us.</p>

<p>When interviewing the public officials about the wireless crisis, they informed us, rather bluntly, during a game of casual ping pong to “mind your own business; can’t you see we are busy?”</p>

<p>Manishlakov offers this hypothesis: “computer told me that I was using an outdated password and that my free week trial was now over, therefore, the internet well is dry and needs to be primed.” Manishlakov informs us that his business will not suffer and is able to be returned to at any time after the internet returns, when he feels like it.</p>

<p>Public officials plan to kickstart the internet with an array of technological workarounds, involving a cable, a wire cutter, and a lot of silver tape. With internet discovered near the border with neighboring capitalist country (Codename: “Not-Truslavistan”), the fix should come soon, as long as Bogdan remembers to cut the “small wire, not big one.”</p>
