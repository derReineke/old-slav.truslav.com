		<p><em>THURSDAY</em> – In what many are considering a breakthrough moment for the micronation of Truslavistan, the people’s country has birthed a modern tech miracle. After years of research, trial-and-error, Petrov Manishlakov has managed to start the first-ever online business from his state-issued apartment in the downtown square.</p>

<p>“I was ready to give up,” Manishlakov admits, “until that shining moment occurred at 3 in the morning and my breakthrough happened.” Manishlakov sits, beaming with pride, near his computer set-up. From his living room we can see that his apartment is filled with the opulence of a standard Slavic household, a paradigm of antique collectibles worth nothing at all.</p>

<p>Manishlakov lives a bachelor, serving his country as the people’s modern explorer from the chambers of the centralized economic planning division in the capital. Government officials inform me my use of “capital” in this case is allowed, but not to go crazy with it or else I might be in time of hard labors in “sad lonely time behind iron cage.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been trying for months to decipher the code preventing access to the wireless.” Manishlakov shares his process: “I had to put myself in the shoes of those monsters, the westerners, and ask myself, ‘Petrov, if you were greedy unfair nogoodnik, what would set as your password for access to the world wide interwebs, of which, I am so greedily keeping to mineself?”</p>

<p>“The answer was obvious.” He shows me on his computer, this bright, beautiful, but simple machine worth the yearly salary of the local farmer. “You replace the ‘S’ in ‘PASSWORD’ with the ‘$,’ and just like that, I was in.”</p>

<p>This breakthrough has many locals concerned, including Baba Virololosky, who pointed out, “how does one know if the computer is on?” However, experts have calmed the people, telling them: “we must know to push the ‘on’ button while the computer remains plugged into wall socket, preferably surge protector, but not when it is unplugged, because then, it will not work.”</p>

<p>Manishlakov is currently setting up an affiliate marketing business of which he hopes to sell the “dirty wares of capitalism” back to their “materialist worshipping slaves.”</p>
