**MONDAY** – After an accidental leak of classified information by erroneous ex-journalist Papov Pavokovish in last week’s publication, 


mass shortages of bandwidth were observed to have occurred on the People’s Wireless after the top secret password was published for all to see. 


With the normal leaks of top secret information resulting in instant death under the hoofs of a hundred hungry swine, 


Pavokovish received a lighter sentence after saying he was, in essence, “giving interwebs to the peoples.” 


Officials have told me he is “somewhere nice with lots of stone floors.”


Luckily, Petrov Manishlakov has been able to keep his internet start-up steady and growing despite the lack of bandwidth.  


He has pivoted his business to resell used gym clothing online, stating that he has sold an “unprecedented number of items at a low but fair price,”


 seeing sales as large as 3 items in single day, beating his old record of “maybe one.” He saves monies by not washing the clothing before shipping, but has claimed it has left him nose-blind.
 
 
The effect internet has had on the public cannot be underestimated. Just yesterday, the younger members of society were using the new acronyms in commonspeak during class. 


Mutterings of “LOL (leave our latkas),” ROFL (remove owls from latkas, presumably our own),” and DLC “Dishonorable Like Capitalism,” could be heard from every school yard. 


Even the Baba Surveillance Program is benefitting from instantly sending notifications to the masses, but fear abuse of the new technology would undermine the values learned from shouting gossip from the seat of a bicycle whist riding through the town.


Centralized authorities have commented that they have observed a potential problem in the wireless infrastructure that they fear could cripple the network. They were ousted by their peers today, in public, in only their state-issued underwear, wearing conical hats with “Dunce-nikov” written on them. 


Dmitri Duncenikov commented on the affair saying it was “slanderous,” and when two seconds later for a follow-up question, replied: “what hats?”
